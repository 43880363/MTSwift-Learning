# MTSwift-Learning

As a Designer,I begin to learn swift,try to make some simple project here

_I'm newbie,but I'm forwarding._

##Day7:Reading "Swift Development with Cocoa"
![Day7](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/4.Swift%20Development%20with%20Cocoa/Part%201/parti.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned:

1.Basic knowledge abt "closure [x]/int [x]/protocol [x]/extension [x]",still needs to review.

2.theory abt "lifecycle/constraints [x]"

3.Make 3 example —— AlertView/DynamicSnap(Used Pan Gesture Recognize & UIDynamicAnimator)/OperationQueue(theory abt OperationQueue & Closure [x])

4.Plan to learn more from http://mathewsanders.com/ tomorrow

##Day8:Animation from MathewSanders.com
![Day8](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/5.MathewSanders.com/part1.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned(From MathewSanders.com):

1.(Animation 1)use "arc4random_uniform()" to generate random Int,"for in" to play more times animation/How to get value from UISlider

2.(Animation 2)UIView.TransitionWithView,now I can use modal transiton in ViewController

3.(The whole demo)put all animation into one demo,review the theory abt "prepareForSegue"/get selectedRowAtIndexPath to make segue transition[?]/tableView[?]

4.(Animation 3)Learned add keyframe into animation to make effect better/Reviewed Path + Keyframeanimation

5.(Animation 4)Learned stroke Animation/set ovalpath's anchorpoint、clockwise、radius/How to use SystemAnimation

6.Plan to Learn Progress concept tomorrow,try to design these demo with funny idea.

##Day9:Add a Pinterest-like Longpress effect(but has bugs)
![Day9](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/4.Swift%20Development%20with%20Cocoa/Part%201/DynamicSnap/DynamicSnap.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned

1.We can use UIDynamicItemBehavior & allowsRotation to remove SnapBehavior's 3D Strench.

2.Try to learn UIcollisionBehavior[x],but failed,I should learn swift from basic knowledge

To be contiuned...

##Day10:Transition from MathewSanders.com 
![Day10](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/5.MathewSanders.com/transition1.gif?raw=true)
![Day10-1](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/6.Read(WIP)/0.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.Keep reviewing Transionmanager & how to use cotainer & segue to customize animation

2.Add an prototype named "惬读" made with Form ,plan to implement it

3.I have learned Swift for 10Day(or even more).It's not good to learn new knowledge everyday,I need sometime to review what I learned,also I wanna make all these project better & designer-like.So,I paused this plan.

##Day11:Transitionmanager(Make your transition code tidy) 
![Day11](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/5.MathewSanders.com/t2m1m2.gif?raw=true)
![Day11-1](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/5.MathewSanders.com/t2m3.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.Keep reviewing Transionmanager ,which made some animation a pattern to re-use anyway in app

2.try to use "present modally" & "over full screen"(try other options,effect will be different) in segue.Now I can part show previous ViewController(Just change second ViewControler's property like opacity/scale/rotation)

3.set a variable(like presenting) in transitionmanager,I can use self.presenting+if/else make switch.I can also use self.presenting before animation block to init propertys of view

##Day12:Recreate Yahoo News Digest by using UITableView(From Designer TearDown)
![Day12](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/1-Stretchy-headers/1.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.in sometime,the constraints can be used for stick a view to another scrollview

2.I had learned Matthew Cheok's brillant way of making cut off

3.To make code tidy,we must note delegate&datesource,separate modal、view&viewcontroller

4.use some global variable

##Day13:Recreate Elastic Drawer(From Designer TearDown)
![Day13](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/2.Elasticdrawer/drawer2.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.Use Simple state in iOS

2."private let" for global using 

3.Also use "var tracking: Bool = false"(Or true) to animate by gesture or just animate automaticly

4.This is a good example of UIBezierPath,I try to sketch some path on my note,learned a lot,but not enough

##Day14:Zooming Icons(From Design TearDown)
![Day14](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/3.ZommingIcons/1.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.use constraint to aniamte element's Position 

2.use snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates to snape some key element,then fromView->animate snapshotview->toView(Another way of making TransitionManger fromVC->animate->animate->TOVC)

3.try to pass date(modal) between VC

4.try to make a protocol

5.learn some right way of making constraint

6.still have bugs in constraint animation,try to fix it later.

##Day15:Rooms(From Design TearDown)
![Day15](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/4.Rooms/1.gif?raw=true)

What I learned

1.In Swift, everything is public by default. Define your variables outside the classes.(Can use everywhere)

2.Keep going with protocol/pass date/ TransitionManager

3.the meaning of "let duration = NSTimeInterval(progress) * ContentViewAnimationDuration"


##Day16:IntroductionTips(From Design TearDown)
![Day16](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/5.Introduction-Tips/333.gif?raw=true)

1.MVC

2.UIDynamic

3.Dispatch for delay

##Day17:Expanding Cells(From Design TearDown)
![Day17](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/7.Design-TearDowns/6.Expanding-Cells/333.gif?raw=true)

1.Extension Class(UIColor)

2.Learning Protocol to pass date between VC

3.Keep Learning Button

4.Use for in & index to layout button 

5.WillDisappear &Appear + true & false to animate(I just need to animate two state,define two state first)

6.SnapShot For TransitionManager

7. Use For in Control flow & Delay animation,animate cell step by step(knowledge about animate tableviewcell)
