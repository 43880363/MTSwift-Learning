What I Learned:

1.Gif sequence

2.Simple 3D-like slidemenu effect

##Day7:Reading "Swift Development with Cocoa"
![Day7](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/4.Swift%20Development%20with%20Cocoa/Part%201/parti.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned:

1.Basic knowledge abt "closure [x]/int [x]/protocol [x]/extension [x]",still needs to review.

2.theory abt "lifecycle/constraints [x]"

3.Make 3 example —— AlertView/DynamicSnap(Used Pan Gesture Recognize & UIDynamicAnimator)/OperationQueue(theory abt OperationQueue & Closure [x])

4.Plan to learn more from http://mathewsanders.com/ tomorrow

##Day8:Example from MathewSanders.com
![Day8](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/5.MathewSanders.com/part1.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned(From MathewSanders.com):

1.(Animation 1)use "arc4random_uniform()" to generate random Int,"for in" to play more times animation/How to get value from UISlider

2.(Animation 2)UIView.TransitionWithView,now I can use modal transiton in ViewController

3.(The whole demo)put all animation into one demo,review the theory abt "prepareForSegue"/get selectedRowAtIndexPath to make segue transition[?]/tableView[?]

4.(Animation 3)Learned add keyframe into animation to make effect better/Reviewed Path + Keyframeanimation

5.(Animation 4)Learned stroke Animation/set ovalpath's anchorpoint、clockwise、radius/How to use SystemAnimation

6.Plan to Learn Progress concept tomorrow,try to design these demo with funny idea.

##Day9:Add a Pinterest-like Longpress effect(but has bugs)
![Day9](https://github.com/MartinRGB/MTSwift-Learning/blob/master/4.Swift%20Development%20with%20Cocoa/Part%201/DynamicSnap/DynamicSnap.gif?raw=true
)

What I learned

1.We can use UIDynamicItemBehavior & allowsRotation to remove SnapBehavior's 3D Strench.

2.Try to learn UIcollisionBehavior[x],but failed,I should learn swift from basic knowledge

To be contiuned...
